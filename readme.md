#BSDHistory

This is repo for https://bsdhistory.discoverbsd.com, website to share short *twitter-sized* facts about history of BSD based OSes.

##Contribute
You can add your own fact via github fork mechanism.

* fork
* add your stuff to data/data.json
* create PR

### data.json

Format is pretty much self-explanatory.

```json
{
  "text": "#BSDHistory : #MirOS BSD started on 29. August 2002, combining OpenBSD (-current) and NetBSD (-current) at that time",
  "link":"https://www.mirbsd.org/history.htm"
}

```
So when forking, add your own and then create PR so someone can fact check it. Length of text should not be more than 100 characters (because we want to be able to share it on twitter).

# BSDHistory

This is repo for https://bsdhistory.discoverbsd.com, website to share short *twitter-sized* facts about history of BSD based OSes.

## More information

* article at [DiscoverBSD](https://discoverbsd.blogspot.com/2015/07/introducing-bsdhistory.html) (announcement)

* create pull request ([tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).)

### -bsd-.json

Each OS has its file, eg: `miros.json` for MirOS. Format is pretty much self-explanatory.

```json
{
  "text": "#BSDHistory : #MirOS BSD started on 29 Aug 2002, combining #OpenBSD (-current) and #NetBSD (-current) at that time",
  "link":"https://www.mirbsd.org/history.htm"
}

```
So when forking, add your own and then create PR so someone can fact check it. Length of text should not be more than 100 characters (because we want to be able to share it on twitter).

If you are adding whole new OS, do not forget to add it to `js/script.js`, line 6.
